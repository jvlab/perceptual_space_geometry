# perceptual_space_geometry
This repository has code for analysis of the geometry of perceptual spaces, mostly based on the Waraich JoVE paradigm.  Data are imported either as coordinates (data with names like *coord*.mat) or triad choice probabilities (data files with names like *choice*.mat, but also, for test files, psg_tentlike_test*.mat).  
Typical outputs are visualizations of the perceptual spaces, or a posteriori likelihoods of consistency with symmetry, ultrametric geometry, or addtree geometry.
