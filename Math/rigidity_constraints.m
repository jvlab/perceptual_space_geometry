function [params,opts_used]=rigidity_constraints(overlaps,opts)
% [params,opts_used]=rigidity_constraints(overlaps,opts) computes the number of pairwise distances given several datasets with partial overlaps 
%
% overlaps: 2-d array, nstims x nsets, 1 = data available
% opts: options structure
%
% params: structure with fields
%    npairs: total number of pairwise distances within the same dataset
%    nmax: maximum number of pairwise distances, if all points were in the same datasaet
%    nstims: number of stimuli (from rows of overlaps)
%    nstims_used: number of stimuli used in at least one set
%    counts: 2-d array [nstims nstims], number of sets containing each pair distance
%    nfree: 1-d array, length is nsets, number of points in each dataset that are not connected with any other dataset
%    nbound: 1-d array, length is nsets, number of points in each dataset that are connected to some point in another dataset
%    novlp: 2-d array [nsets nsets], number of overlaps between each pair of datasets
%    dmax_free: maximum dimension that is rigidly constrained by bound points, equal to min(nbound-1) for all datasets with nfree>0
%    dmax_constraints: maximum dimension for which number of coordinates to be found, minus offset and rotational d.o.f., does not exceed number of pairs of distances
%    dmax: min(dmax_free,dmax_constraints)
%    
% opts_used: options used
